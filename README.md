Problem Statement : Resume Builder
The resume builder application made in Django helps to make impressive resumes easily within a few minutes .Building a resume with no help would be a difficult task like deciding layout , text , display necessary field ,etc . So to overcome these difficulties , I came up with a web resume builder that takes basic information such as name,email-id,mobile no.,address,some skills, past experience etc. of the aspirant required when applying for a job. It provides professional resumes, instantly generated by the resume builder .The important aim of this project is to help employees to land their dream job with the perfect resumes .
